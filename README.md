Learning HTML and CSS and making the code more accessible.


3/20/22

I updated the HTML by changing most of the divs into more descriptive semantic elements.
Removed certain classes that were redundant once a more fitting element name was in place. Changed some of the classes to ids because they were more specific. There were 3 unique classes that had all the same CSS declarations so I changed them to a single class to cut down on redundancies in the CSS.

I added a title to the page and alt tags for the pictures. I added some comments into the CSS to let people know what I changed in the actual file.

3/24/22

I added alt tags to the img in aside.
